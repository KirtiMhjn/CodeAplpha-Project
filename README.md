image Gallery Satup Project -1

Here's a basic implementation of an image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example will allow users to view a collection of images and navigate through them using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Explanation -

 HTML: The gallery consists of a container with an image element and navigation buttons.
 CSS: The layout is centered using flexbox, with styles for buttons and image scaling.
 JavaScript: An array stores the image filenames. The "Next" and "Previous" buttons navigate through the array, updating the displayed image.
 You can replace "d.jpg", "a.jpg", etc., with the actual paths to your images.
